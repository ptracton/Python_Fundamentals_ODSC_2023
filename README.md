# Python Fundamentals for ODSC Europe 2023

This is the git repository for a half day class that will get students up and running in the Python language.

## Before the Class!

1. **Install Anaconda Python**

Download the [latest distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) for your OS.  It currently supports Windows, Mac OS and Linux.  The key difference between Anaconda and [default python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is the packages that come with it.  Anaconda will automatically install more libraries that can be of use to you.  Anaconda is known for being data science focused.


WARNING!! 

I recently had trouble installing the latest version of Anaconda on a Windows 10 laptop.  The last few versions failed to install correctly for me.  

2. **Install Jupyter Lab**

Once Anaconda Python is installed and running, you will also need to install [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html).  There are 2 main methods of installation.  The first is with conda, which is a package management tool for Anaconda Python.  The second is with pip, which is the generic python package manager.  

Test out if this worked by [starting jupyter lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/starting.html).  To do this you will need to open a command prompt on your PC.  For Mac OS/Linux it is a shell and for Windows it is the command prompt.  From there you will need to type the following:

jupyter lab

This will start the webserver that acts as our development environment.


## Syllabus

This is a 3 hour class.  It is broken up into 3 parts.  Each part will be about 30-45 minutes followed by a short lab to try out the topics just covered.  hands on trying out of code is critical to learning.  Lab instructions and solutions will be provided.

1. **Installation and Basics**

We will start with installation if this was not done before the class started.  Students need both anaconda python and jupyter labs.  Once installed, this part of the lecture will cover:

    1. Numeric types
    
    2. Strings
    
    3. Lists
    
    4. Dictionaries


2. **Program Flow**

This part of the course will cover programming syntax.  The topics will include

    1. If/else
    
    2. For loops
    
    3. Try/Except
    
    4. Functions
    
    5. File Handling
    

3. **Additional Code**

This part of the course will introduce students to using both built in and external 3rd party code.

    1. import
    
    2. Try out Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib together
    
    
    
## Goals
By the end of this class students should be familiar with the basics of using the python language through the Jupyter Labs interface.
