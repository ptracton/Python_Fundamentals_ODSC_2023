      \begin{itemize}
      \item Functions are a way of breaking up the code into more manageable pieces.
      \item There are 4 types of Functions

          \pause
        \item Global are available to everyone in the module
          \pause
        \item Local are functions inside of functions
          \pause
        \item Lambda are limited functions that are created just in time to use them
          \pause
        \item Methods are associated with a specific data type and part of Object Oriented Programming

\begin{Slide}{Names and DocStrings}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item PEP 8 rules on \underline{\href{https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/\#function-names}{Function Names}}
  \item Use good clear names for the functions, should indicate what the function does
  \item Avoid abbreviations
  \item Docstrings are comments that come right after the def line of the function.  It should indicate what the function does and how to use it.  
\item Docstrings have their own PEP, \underline{\href{https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/}{PEP 257}}
\item Although \underline{\href{https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/\#documentation-strings}{PEP 8}} also has some thoughts
  \end{itemize}

\begin{Slide}{Function Arguments}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Does not type check
  \begin{itemize}
  \item you can manually check if you wish
  \end{itemize}
\item All values are passed by reference
 \begin{itemize}
  \item immutable types can't be modified by a function
  \end{itemize}
\item Arguments are local variables 
\item Arguments go out of scope when functions return
\item Without a return statement, the function returrns \textbf{None}

      \item Specify a default value for a function argument 
\item If no value is given for this parameter when the function is called, the default value is used
\item This is very handy!
